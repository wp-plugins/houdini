Provides a method to copy protect your webpages from plagiarism and content theft.

== Description ==

The fact is the internet is open can lead to theft especially to content stealing and plagiarism.

Until now, there was very little to discourage and deter this serious crime. Yes content theft and
plagarism is a crime in some jurisdictions.

You cannot rely on others or the authorities to continue to police the internet as they
do not have enough resources. You need to protect your content and deter this theft.

The basic form of content theft is to copy and paste your content to another medium. 

Well Houdini, prevents this using a little known special algorithm that prevents copying by
making the selected text that is targeted by the perps to be copied, to disappear! Yes disappear!!!
The only way to recover is to reload the page in the web browser. If they try again, the content
disappears again. As long as they keep trying to select and copy your content, the content will disappear
before they can get a chance to execute the copy command!

After a few unsuccessful attempts, the theives will move on to a easier target.

Your safe!
